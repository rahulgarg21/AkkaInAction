AkkaInAction

These examples are inspired by book Akka In Action By Raymond Rosestenburg, Rob Bakker, Rob Williams

Although there is a github respository for the book examples - I found naming conventions for the messages
confusing and some things which after further reading book like Effective Akka to be less than ideal.

I tried to learn from book examples by improving on the provided by the book.
