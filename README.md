Akka In Action

These examples are inspired by book Akka In Action By Raymond Rosestenburg, Rob Bakker, Rob Williams http://www.manning.com/roestenburg/

Although there is a github respository for the book examples - I found naming conventions for the messages confusing and some things which after further reading books like Effective Akka can be done in better way.
 
I tried to learn from book examples by improving on the code provided by the book. The code may look similar as far as naming convention but there are subtle differences to make code more understandble and robust.
